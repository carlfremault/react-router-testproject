# react-router-testproject

A small project to practice using the react-router-dom package including actions and loaders, as well as a very basic Express backend.

Oh yeah. This turned out to be another Notes app...

## What I've learned so far

-   Setting up a monorepo fullstack Typescript/React/Express app
-   Implementing basic routing using React-router-dom's CreateBrowserRouter
-   Implementing loader and action functions, including deferring
-   Setting up basic CRUD API routes in the backend

## What I'd do differently next time

I should have used npm workspaces with one single Typescript config for both frontend and backend. Then I could use the same types and validation schemas everywhere.

## Motivations

I've been working as a Front-end React developer for little over 6 months now. On the job I can work on some pretty big applications and websites. I have plenty of occasions to get my hands dirty with a lot of different packages & technologies, both front and back end.

Working on existing projects however, with an active userbase, one is not entirely free to do as one pleases, as there are company conventions, best practices, and rules to be respected. Results must be obtained, objectives met and users' needs taken care of.

As a junior developer it turns out that a lot of the time I am picking existing solutions from our code base and adapting them to the current situation. Obviously this is a very rewarding process, and I am happily learning tons of new things every day.

Quite often however, when I take a step back and verify some code before submitting a merge request, I realize that I would not have succeeded writing all that code from scratch on my own, without peeking left and right through the different applications written by my senior colleagues.

So I continue working through a few Udemy courses during my free time, on React, Node.js and Javascript. What I learn is a lot less complex than what I'm doing during working hours but I believe it's very important to get the basics down to the last little detail. Also, this allows me to practice writing 'from scratch' which is exactly what I feel I need to work on to become a better developer.
